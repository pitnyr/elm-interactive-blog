## Setup

I want everything to be done on feature branches, so the first commit is empty:

[commit-2021-12-01-11-29](https://github.com/pitnyr/elm-interactive-blog/commit/8f1382ecc2be0b084c16c2c621fbef919561ce60)
```email
subject: Add empty root commit
```

<a id="commit-2021-12-02-20-50"></a>

The remaining setup is handled in feature branch [setup](setup.md).
A part of this is setting up an elm-book environment.
